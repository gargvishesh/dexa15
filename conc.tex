\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
Designing database query execution algorithms for PCM platforms
requires a change in perspective from the traditional assumptions of
symmetric read and write overheads.  We presented here a variety of
modified algorithms for the workhorse database operators: \emph{sort},
\emph{join} and \emph{group-by}, which were constructed with a view
towards simultaneously reducing both the number of writes and the
overall query response time. Through detailed experimentation on benchmark
environments, we showed that substantial improvements on these metrics can
be obtained as compared to their contemporary PCM-oblivious counterparts.
Collaterally, the PCM cell lifetimes are also greatly extended by our
approaches.

Note that while our experiments were conducted on a PCM simulator, the
cycle-accurate nature of the simulator makes it likely that similar
performance will be exhibited in the real world as well. Moreover,
our write estimators facilitate the incorporation of these algorithms
in the query optimizer, as we have shown in our implementation.
